# 120 years of Olympic history Analysis

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of Olympic data using SQL queries.

By leveraging the dataset, I aim to answer a wide range of questions related to the Olympics, such as the total number of nations participating in each Olympic Games, 
the top 5 athletes who have won the most gold medals, and the top 5 most successful countries in the Olympics.

## How to install and run the project

1.	Download the project repository to your computer.
2.	Open the PostgreSQL or MySQL database management tool.
3.	Create a new database for the project and import the provided dataset.
4.	Install any necessary dependencies or packages required for the project.
5.	Execute the project using the provided instructions.
6.	Analyze the Olympic data by running the provided SQL queries in the PostgreSQL or MySQL tool.

## Key Achievements

The Olympic Data Analysis project has achieved significant insights and findings. Here are two key achievements:
1.	Highest and Lowest Participating Countries: Through the analysis, we discovered that the Olympic Games in 2016 had the highest number of participating countries,
	 with a total of 204 nations. On the other hand, the 1896 Summer Olympics had the lowest participation, with only 12 countries competing.

3.	Top 5 Most Successful Countries: By evaluating the historical Olympic data, we determined the top 5 most successful countries in terms of overall performance.
   The United States emerged as the number one country, showcasing remarkable dominance and success in the Olympics.

## Sources of the project
Kaggle: The project utilizes data downloaded from Kaggle, which consists of two CSV files containing Olympic data.

CSV Files: These CSV files serve as the primary data source for the project, containing information about Olympic events, athletes, countries, and medal outcomes.

PostgreSQL Database: The CSV files were uploaded to a PostgreSQL database for efficient storage and retrieval, serving as the data source for performing SQL queries 
and analysis.
